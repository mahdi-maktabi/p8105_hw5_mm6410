## Question 1

``` r
bday_sim = function(n) {
  
  bdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)

  duplicate = length(unique(bdays)) < n

  return(duplicate)
  
}

bday_sim(10)
```

    ## [1] FALSE

``` r
sim_res =
  expand_grid(
    n = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000
  ) |> 
  mutate(res = map_lgl(n, bday_sim)) |> 
  group_by(n) |> 
  summarize(prob = mean(res))

sim_res |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) +
  geom_line()
```

The function and figure show the probablity that at least two people in
a room share a birthday between (n = 2 and n = 50). We can see that as
we increase the number of people in the room, the probability of the
same birthday steadily increases. When we get to 50 people, the
probability is close to 100%.
